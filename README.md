## Hi, I'm Rose!  ðŸ‘‹
### :woman: Pronouns: She, Her

I am a Full Stack Web Developer based out of Vancouver, British Columbia. I have an Associates degree in Criminal Justice and a Bachelors degree in Music, but decided to move into programming to use my logical, detail oriented nature to its full potential. Since then I have successfully completed the Full Stack Web Development program at Lambda School.
