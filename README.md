# Hi, I'm Rose!  ðŸ‘‹
### :woman: Pronouns: She, Her

I am a Full Stack Web Developer based out of Vancouver, British Columbia. I have an A.A. in Criminal Justice and a B.A. in Music, but decided to move into computer programming in order to channel my attention to detail and analysis, into my career. I have successfully completed the Full Stack Web Development course with Lambda School and been fully endorsed. Since then I've had a contract position as a Junior Web Developer, and a short term position as a Web Developer. I'm currently looking for my next opportunity!
