## Hi there, I'm Rose!  ðŸ‘‹
### ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She, Her

I am a Full Stack Web Developer originally from Western New York. I have degrees in both Criminal Justice and Music Ministry, but decided to move into a programming career path to use my logical and detail oriented nature to its full potential.

### ðŸŒ± Currently I am:

- Learning better problem solving and algorithmic skills.

- Working on completing the Full Stack Web Development track at Lambda School.

### ðŸ’¡ My goals include:

- Learning more about Docker, Testing, and GraphQL.

### âš¡ Fun facts:

- I love to travel and experience new things!
- When I can't travel, I love to read, as well as explore the area I live.
